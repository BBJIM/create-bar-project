# Build Of This Project

The create react app build simply uses the react-scripts build option
which gives us an optimized gzipped minifed and uglifed build.

This project does'nt make use of the React.lazy and dynamic imports
(code splitting), because as is, it is not a big project so if you
want to make a more optimized build you can learn more about it
[here](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html)
