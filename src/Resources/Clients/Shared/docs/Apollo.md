# Apollo

(_only apollo projects_)

Apollo is a state managment library that uses graphQL for requests and data.

To use a graphQL apollo state you can use the `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks in your components.

Your queries you can write in the `Logic` folder, while all the state data is in the `Apollo` folder.

Examples are in the Apollo projects in pages like `ChangeTheme` or `Table`.
