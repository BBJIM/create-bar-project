# Build Of This Project

The normal react build simply uses the create-react-app react-scripts build option
which gives us an optimized gzipped minifed and uglifed.

This project does'nt make use of the React.lazy and dynamic imports (code splitting), because as is it is not a big project so if you want to make a more optimized build you can learn more about it here:https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html
